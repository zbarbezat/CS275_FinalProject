# Project Details
Our project will be a simple web application whose primary function will be to generate relevant information about a selected artist’s upcoming concerts and then allow the user to listen to songs by this artist. The information about an artist’s upcoming events will contain items like event date, start time, event location, age restrictions, and more. A small biography about the selected artist will also be provided to the user.
